"Canadian Cities" was a project to be done in groups of three. Collaborating with two others, we were to create a C# console application that would demonstrate being able to work with three different filetypes (XML, CSV, & JSON).

After deserializing from either XML, CSV, or JSON, we then allow the user to input some commands to view the information.
