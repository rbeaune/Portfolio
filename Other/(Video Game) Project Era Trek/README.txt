This project is codenamed "Era Trek;" A small RPG-style video game I had been working on in my spare time for a hobby.

This project was created in "RPG Maker VX Ace" by Enterbrain. Games made with this application use RGSS3 or "Ruby Game Scripting System", which otherwise means using just ruby to program with.
The "__RPG.rb" file is the base code that came with the engine and any other file with the extension ".rb" contain overwrites, aliases and new classes and/or functions.
